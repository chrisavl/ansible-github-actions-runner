<h1 align="center">GitHub Actions self-hosted Runner Ansible role</h1>

Work In Progress.

All-in-all the features of this Ansible role are implemented just not
documented and well-presented yet. Ansible Galaxy repository import and
documentation about the variables are on its way.

To-dos:

- [ ] Improve this README with variables + instructions;
- [ ] Import to Ansible Galaxy;
- [ ] Add CI using molecule;
- [ ] Integrate GitHub actions to run the CI;
- [ ] Add Code lint (YAML lint + ansible lint) on CI;
- [ ] Include documentation
